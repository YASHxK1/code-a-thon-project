In one sentence, I would say the following:Recognize that while you and your partner probably have common interests and areas of commonality, you are separate people, each with different wants, wishes, and desires \\u2013 if you consider a diagram of two overlapping circles, they may share perhaps a third of the circle with overlap to indicate commonality (could be more or less) and then there are parts of the circles that are not overlapping, indicating separate interestsAs for ways that may strengthen any relationship, even the great ones, this is what came to mind. There are certainly more specific unique answers or elements for different people as far as the details, but here are some general ideas:Try to have at least 15 minutes a week where you are spending time together and not problem-solvingRealize that listening to your partner does not mean that you are agreeing with them, it just means that you are saying that you hear where they are coming fromLearn to hold on to your own wants, wishes, and desires while also recognizing those of your partnerSet boundaries for what is and isn't acceptable behavior during an argument or difficult discussionDiscuss how having important discussions can be anxiety-producing and consider having an understanding that if one of you (or both of you) feels overwhelmed, you can take a timeout for a certain amount of time. For example, you may say \\\"okay, I'm feeling really stressed about this right now. Let's discuss it in an hour.\\\" And at that time, go back to the discussionConsider what your partner's top three or four complaints about you may be. Check in with them and see how accurate you are. If you see validity in their responses, consider whether or not you may want to make changesDiscover what makes your partner feel loved, valued, appreciated, or specialRelationships are always in progress and constantly changing. Some anxiety around change is typical. Being able to effectively discuss the anxiety and actually listen to one another without being defensive, name calling, finger-pointing, or asking each other to change is a true gift.You may enjoy this quote:\\u00a0\\\"Connection is the energy that is created between people when they feel seen, heard, and valued; when they can give and receive without judgment.\\\" ~Brene Brown\",\n          \"There are some great thoughts offered by others here.\\u00a0I would just add that typically the most natural response to fearful thoughts is to want to stop, avoid, or get rid of them - which doesn't work if you're really caught up in a cycle of OCD or other form of anxiety.\\u00a0In the long run, the more effective thing to do is the harder and less intuitive option: to have those uncomfortable thoughts on purpose.\\u00a0This may mean writing out in detail what the worst case fear you are thinking of is, and then reading it over and over again until it becomes boring. It may also mean pausing through the course of the day to merely observe all the thoughts going on, and realizing that thoughts are merely thoughts. They are not the same as reality, and the unpleasant ones can become a lot less scary when we realize we can coexist with them without them coming true.\",\n          \"That sounds really heartbreaking. It is tough falling in love and not being able to dive fully because of complications on the other side. It sounds to me that you are doing exactly what you need to be doing by taking \\\"care of myself\\\" while the rest sorts itself out. While I admire your desire and courage to stay friends - the \\\"extreme pain\\\" that you mentioned may make this too challenging and at odds with your taking care of yourself. Since there is no commitment on her end to give it a shot with you I would make sure that you really honour your own feelings about what feels right to you so that you don't end up feeling strung along or resentful. Make sure that you lean on friends and family at this time - we need all the support that we can get when we are heartbroken.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

\\n sometimes talking about problems or concerns can really help\\u2014in fact, many people who experience a mood disorder say that they just want to be heard. it\\u2019s important to understand that talking about something difficult like experiences of depression can be very hard for your loved one. you cannot force them to talk about it, but you can invite them to, and create safe and quiet spaces to talk. if a loved one opens up to you, listen actively\\u2014that is, without distractions like your phone or the tv. really pay attention to what they have to say. listen with empathy and without judgement. even if you don\\u2019t understand the problem or see the problem in a different way, your main concern is the distress or difficult feelings your loved one is experiencing. you can find in-depth tips on listening and communicating well in module three of the family toolkit. some people are not ready to talk about everything at once, or at all. that\\u2019s okay! respect your loved one\\u2019s boundaries and let them tell you what they\\u2019re ready to talk about. \\n even when you have the best intentions, unsolicited advice can be unhelpful. you likely can\\u2019t fix the problem, and you may not know the whole story. if you\\u2019d like to share what worked for you in a similar situation, you can ask if the other person would like to talk about strategies that worked for you. \\n different people need different things\\u2014don\\u2019t assume you know what\\u2019s best! some people need emotional help, like someone they can talk with. other people may have a good relationship with a counsellor or other professional, but they might need practical help, like help around the house or help sticking to their treatment plan. and others may simply want to be included in some social events. by asking what a person needs, you may also be less tempted to give advice. \\n when people experience an episode of depression, they can have a lot of very negative thoughts and feelings. this can take a real toll on others. it\\u2019s a good idea to seek support for yourself\\u2014there are support groups just for family members and friends. the bc schizophrenia society has a directory of family support groups around bc for any mental illness. \\n if your loved one isn\\u2019t happy with their treatment or would like to try a different option, you can also help them seek different resources or services. you can find general advice in the ask us section of heretohelp. to find local services, call the bc mental health support line at 310-6789 (no area code) or email us. \\n this is very important! you are not responsible for your loved one\\u2019s treatment (unless your loved one is your child under 19)\\u2014but you can support them as they work towards recovery. in most cases, your loved one\\u2019s treatment and recovery plans are their choice\\u2014you are there to offer support and encouragement. \\n in order for any treatment to work, your loved one needs to be actively involved. forcing or threatening treatment generally doesn\\u2019t work and will only hurt everyone involved. in most cases, anyone 19 years of age and older is free to make their own choices. and their choices may include refusing treatment or choosing a treatment you disagree with. it\\u2019s important to be respectful and keep honest communication open between you. you can learn more about dealing with this situation in ask us: an adult in my life seems ill and won\\u2019t find help. what can i do? \\n if your loved one says that they have thoughts of ending their life, it\\u2019s important to take action. call 1-800-suicide (1-800-784-2433) at any time or message online at www.crisiscentrechat.ca between noon and 1am. if you think your loved one is in immediate danger, you can always call 911 or go to a hospital emergency room.\",\n          \"okay what do you need advice on?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Al-Powered Virtual Mental Health Consultant
Access to mental health support is often hindered by barriers like cost, stigma, and availability. Traditional virtual therapy lacks immersion and personalized interaction. There is a need for a scalable, accessible solution that provides private, empathetic, and real-time support. By leveraging Al and 3D technology, we aim to create a personalized virtual mental health consultant, powered by a custom Large Language Model (LLM), that offers interactive, on-demand mental health guidance in a private, engaging environment.
